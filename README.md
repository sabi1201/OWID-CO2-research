# Coding 2 Homework 2 – CO₂ Emissions and Energy Consumption

This repository contains the materials for my **Coding 2: Python for Data Analysis** term project.

## Research Question
Is higher energy consumption per capita associated with higher CO₂ emissions per capita, controlling for income and population size?

The analysis uses cross-sectional country-level data from Our World in Data (OWID) for the year 2019.
